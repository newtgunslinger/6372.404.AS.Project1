# 6372.404.AS.Project1
Repo for group project in applied stats 6372 section 404

This Github repo contains all of the datasets we used to analyze the New England Patriots dynasty over the last 18 years as well as SAS code to reproduce our analysis, or even perform your own!

##### 6372.404.PatriotsRegression.R has all of our graphics and code reproduced in R, we used R for our initial analysis and its ease in cleaning some of the data.  We went with SAS for our final project due to its ease in interpreting statistical values that R makes look visually unappealing. 

##### PatriotsYearlyStats.csv  holds the Patriots' performance as a team over the last 18 years.
##### Brady.csv Holds Tom Brady's individual performance in the playoffs over the last 18 years.  

### Both of these datasets were obtained on pro-football-reference.com
